LifeGoals – Android Habit and Goal Tracker

LifeGoals is a personal Android app I built to track my daily and milestone goals.
It’s not meant to be production-ready — **I just wanted something that works for me, so don’t look too closely at the code quality.**

Features

Add daily and milestone goals

Mark goals as completed directly from the home screen widget

Daily goals reset automatically at midnight

Track total points, streaks, and weekly completion rate

Data stored locally with Room (no backend)

Built mostly for experimentation and personal use
